## Hi, I'm Giulia 👋

I am Giulia Malinverno, a passionate Application Engineer @Ansys specialized in low frequency applications.
I hold a Msc. in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in electrical systems by [Univerità degli Studi di Pavia](http://electrical.unipv.eu/).
In my previous experience I worked in the electric motors industry and since joining Ansys I focused more my time in the software development at first
and then in the kick off of the [PyAnsys initiative](https://docs.pyansys.com/) where I contribute to several open-source projects!
