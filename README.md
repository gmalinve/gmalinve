I hold a Msc. in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in electrical systems by [Univerit√† degli Studi di Pavia](http://electrical.unipv.eu/).
In my previous experience I worked in the electric motors industry and since joining Ansys I focused more my time in the software development at first
